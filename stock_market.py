Welcome to Forma.ai stock statement generator! In this problem, you will be coding up a transaction
statement generator for a existing trader on our stock trading system. The inputs are provided below, and
the exact output you are to generate is provided after the inputs.

actions: the timestamped actions that the stock trader performed, it can be BUY or SELL type, and they can
buy or sell a few different stocks. However, you should assume that the number of ticker is not limited to
3 types as in the example below, but potentially infinite, so the ticker should not be hardcoded anywhere.

stock_actions: the timestamped actions that the stock performed regardless of who the trader is. It includes
stock splits, and dividend payouts. Even though these actions are not performed by our trader, it still affects
our trader's portfolios, so it should be recorded in the statement that we prepare.

We are looking for easy to understand/extend program that doesn't perform any unnecessary actions.

Feel free to extend the test cases to include new ones that exercises your program to the fullest.
